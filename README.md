# Rick and Morty 

## ‚ú® Introduction
[**Rick and Morty**](https://search-rick-and-morty.netlify.app) is an application created to search for characters by name, id, or episode. If you like you can add a character to your favorite list. There is no registration so the list of your favorite characters will last until the end of your session.

The app is built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and global storage with [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html). Client server is created with [Vue Apollo](https://apollo.vuejs.org). The application uses [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql) so the app uses graphql in order to create requests.
